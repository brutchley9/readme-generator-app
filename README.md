# README Generator

(This README file was not generated by the application itself, rather it was published to describe the README generator)

For this week's challenge, my task is to utilize Node.js to create a README file generator, a back-end web application that utilizes user inputs through the command line to automatically create a README file. The purpose of this is to allow users to quickly render a file that describes their own application in order to save valuable time trying to create a README file from scratch, streamlining the process of web development even further.
