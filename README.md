# README Generator App


(This README file describes the generator app and was not generated by the app itself!)
    
For this week's challenge, my task is to utilize Node.js to create a README file generator, a back-end web application that utilizes user inputs through the command line to automatically create a README file. The purpose of this is to allow users to quickly render a file that describes their own application in order to save valuable time trying to create a README file from scratch, streamlining the process of web development even further.
